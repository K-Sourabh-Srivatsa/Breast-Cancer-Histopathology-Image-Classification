# Breast-Cancer-Histopathology-Image-Classification

Breast Cancer Histopathology Image Classification: This project focuses on using machine learning and deep learning techniques to automatically categorize breast tissue samples as either malignant or benign. By analyzing microscopic images, the system identifies patterns and features indicative of cancerous or non-cancerous tissue. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) play a crucial role in achieving accurate image classification.
